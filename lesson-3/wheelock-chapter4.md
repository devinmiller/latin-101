Nouns?  Nouns.  Irregular verb too.

## The Second Declension

Second declension neuter endings arethe same as the masculine, except that the nominative, accusative, and vocative are identical to one another: **-um** in the singular, **-a** in the plural.

### Neuters in -_um_

## Declension and Agreement of Adjectives

The paradigms presented so far illustrate the point that, while the base remains constant, the adjective has masculine, feminine, and neuters endings to match the gender of the noun it modifies, with which it likewise agrees in number and case.

## Present Infinitive and Indicative of _Sum_

As the English verb "to be" is irregular, so is the important Latin verb **sum**.  Note that, since sum is an _intransitive linking verb_, we do not refer to its voice as either active of passive.  

**Present infinitive**: _esse, to be_

**Present Indicative**:

| Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- |
| sum, _I am_ | sumus, _we are_ |
| es, _you are_ | estis, _you are_ |
| est, _he (she, it) is, there is_ | sunt, _they are, there are |

## Predicate Nouns and Adjectives

As an intransitive verb, **sum** cannot take a direct object but instead serves to connect the subject of a clause with a noun or adjective in the _predicate_.

Such predicate nouns and adjectives, or _predicate nominatives_, are connected or even equated with the subject by the linking verb, and so they natually agree with the subject in number and case, and wherever possible, in gender as well.

## Substantive Adjectives

The Romans also often used an adjective as a _substantive_, i.e., in place of a noun, just as we do in English.  You will often need to supply _man_ or _men_, _woman_ or _women_, _thing_ or _things_, in accordance with the word's number and gender.

**Bonās saepe laudant**.  _They often praise the good women_.

**Multī sunt stultī**. _Many (men) are foolish_.

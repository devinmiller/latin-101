## The Second Declension

Follows the rules learned for the first: base + endings.  Most second declension nouns are masculine or neurter.  Most second declension masculines have a nominative singular ending **-us** or **-er**.

### Masculines in _-us_

| Case | amīcus, _friend_ | magnus, _great_ | Meaning | Ending |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Singular** | | | | | |
| _Nom._ | amīcus | magnus | _a (the) great friend_ | **-us** |
| _Gen._ | amīcī | magnī | _of a great friend_ | **-ī** |
| _Dat._ | amīcō | magnō | _to/for a great friend_ | **-ō** |
| _Acc._ | amīcum | magnūm | _a great friend_ | **-um** |
| _Abl._ | amīcō | magnō | _by/with/from/into/in a great friend_ | **-ō** |
| _Voc._ | amīce | magne | _O great friend_ | **-e** |
| **Plural** | | | | | |
| _Nom._ | amīcī | magnī | _great friends_ | **-ī** |
| _Gen._ | amīcōrum | magnōrum | _of great friends_ | **-ōrum** |
| _Dat._ | amīcīs | magnīs | _to/for great friends_ | **-īs** |
| _Acc._ | amīcōs | magnōs | _great friend_ | **-ōs** |
| _Abl._ | amīcīs | magnīs | _by/with/from/into/in great friends_ | **-īs** |
| _Voc._ | amīcī | magnī | _O great friend_ | **-ī** |

### Masculines in _-er_

Some second declension **-er** masculines retain the **-e-** in the base, hence the importance of learning the genitive as part of the vocabulary.

| Case | puer, _boy_ | ager, _field_ | magnus, _great_ | Ending |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Singular** | | | | | |
| _Nom._ | puer | ager | magnus | **-er/-us** |
| _Gen._ | puerī | agrī | magnī | **-ī** |
| _Dat._ | puerō | agrō | magnō | **-ō** |
| _Acc._ | puerūm | agrūm | magnūm | **-um** |
| _Abl._ | puerō | agrō | magnō | **-ō** |
| _Voc._ | puer | ager | magne | **-er/-e** |
| **Plural** | | | | | |
| _Nom._ | puerī | agrī | | magnī | **-ī** |
| _Gen._ | puerōrum | agrōrum | magnōrum | **-ōrum** |
| _Dat._ | puerīs | agrīs | magnīs | **-īs** |
| _Acc._ | puerōs | agrōs | magnōs | **-ōs** |
| _Abl._ | puerīs | agrīs | magnīs | **-īs** |
| _Voc._ | puerī | agrī | magnī | **-ī** |

An adjective must agree with the noun it modifies in number, gender, and case; but note from **ager magnus** and **magne** that their endings may not always be _spelled_ the same, nor even must they be of the same declension as seen in **agricola Rōmānus**.

### Apposition

An _appositive_ is a noun that is "positioned next to" another noun. For example:

**Gāium, fīlium meum, in agrō vidēo**.  _I see Gaius, my son, in the field._

Here, **fīlium** is said to be "in apposition with" Gāium.  

Nouns in apposition -

- Always agree in case
- Usually agree in number
- Often agree in gender
- Commonly seperated by commas

## Word Order

Typical word order in a simple Latin sentence or clause is:

1. the subject and its modifiers
1. indirect object and modifiers
1. direct object and modifiers
1. adverbial words or phrases
1. verb

Remember that adjectives and genetive nouns commonly follow the words the modify.

While these patterns should be kept in mind, exceptions to the rules were common.

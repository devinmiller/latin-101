## Basic English Grammer for Learning Latin Part 1

sine quā nōn (_not without which_)

### Basic Parts of Speech

Sample sentence:

_The cowardly cat caught a cold._

- Verbs
  - **caught**
  - A necessity for all grammatically correct sentences
  - Verbs are actions (_caught_) or states of being (_exists_)
  - Don't forget the common linking verb _is (am, are)_
- Nouns
  - **cat, a cold**
  - A person, place, or thing
  - Intangible concepts/ideas (_virtue, courage_)
  - Essential for all sentences in English (at least as the subject)
- Adjectives
  - **cowardly**
  - A word "attached" to the noun
  - Adjectives describe nouns
  - Colors are adjectives and so are numbers
- Adverbs
  - Words like _soon_ and _quickly_
  - Adverbs describe verbs (and other things)
- Prepostional Phrases
  - Short phrases like _in the house_
  - Consist of a preposition (e.g., _in_, _on_, _under_, _with_) followed by a noun

## Basic English Grammer Part II

### Different Types of Verbs and Nouns

Three sentences:

- The phone rings.
- The wonderful Latin student answers the phone.
- Julius Caesar is her friend.

- Verbs
  - **rings, answers, is**
  - Some verbs being the action to another noun
    - These verbs are called **transitive**
    - The _student_ does the answering, and the _phone_ receives the answering
    - The action flows from the _student_, to the verb (_answers_), finally resting on the _phone_
    - The verb carries the action across to another noun
  - Some verbs don't transfer the action to another noun
    - These verbs are called **intransitive**
    - The _ringing_ stops at the _phone_
  - Some verbs simply link two sides of a sentence together
    - These verbs are called **linking verbs**
    - Julius Caeser = her friend
- Nouns
  - Subject
    - **phone, student, Julius Caeser**
    - Every verb has a subject, the noun that controls the verb
    - Almost always come right before the verb, does the action
    - Who or what [insert verb here]?
      - What _rings_? The _phone_
      - Who _answers_? The _student_
      - Who _is_ her friend?  Julias Caeser
  - Direct Object
    - Gets the action from the verb
    - Whom or what [insert subject and verb]
      - What did the _student_ _answer_?  The _phone_
    - Intransitive Verbs -> no direct object
    - Transitive Verbs -> direct object
    - Caveat I
      - Be mindful of prepositional phrases following intransitive verbs
      - Prepositional phrases only describe where or in what way the verb is acting
    - Caveat II
      - Combining _is_ with an _ing_ form of a  verb to show something happening over a period of time
      - Does not make the verbal unit a linking verb

### Summary

- All verbs have a **subject**, controller/doer of the verb/action.
- Some verbs have **direct objects**, receivers of he verb/action.  These are **transitive verbs**.
- Some verbs can't have **direct objects**.  These are **intransitive verbs**.
- **Linking verbs** (e.g., _is_) act like an equals sign (=).

## Instructor's Notes

### Parts of a Sentence

A sentence always contains two required components:

- A **subject**, who does the action (_noun_ or _pronoun_)
- A _verb_, which is the action (or state of being)

For example:

- The **cat** _purrs_.
- The **boy** _is_.
- The **son** _gives_.
- the **arrow** _hits_.

While grammatically correct, they are incomplete thoughts and require more information to communicate what is happening.  Thus, other parts of English sentences are often present.

- **Predicate nominative** (or subject compliment)
  - Tells what the subject is after the verb "to be"
  - For example:
    - The boy is **brave**.

- **Direct object**
  - Receives the action of the verb
  - For example:
    - The gives **a present**.
    - The arrow hits **its mark**.

- **Indirect object**
  - Happens after verbs of giving, telling, or showing and receives the direct object
  - For example:
    - The son gives a present **to his mother**.

- **Prepositional phrase**
  - Comprised of a preposition and a noun
  - Tell where a verb takes place in space or time
  - For example:
    - The son gives a present to his mother **on Mother's Day**.

- _Clause_
  - A complete though, with its own subject and verb
  - Connected to another clause to form a compound sentence
  - Two clauses are connected together with a **conjunction**
  - For example:
    - The son gives a present to his mother on Mother's Day **because** _he loves her_.

Remember that **adjectives** and _adverbs_ can also be added to provide more detail about a noun or verb:

- The son gives a **special** present to his mother on Mother’s Day because he loves her _very_ much.

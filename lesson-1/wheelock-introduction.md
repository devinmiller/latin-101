## Latin Language in History

- **Cognate Languages**
  - Languages that share a common ancestor are referred to as cognate languages
  - English, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Anglo-Saxon, Old Irish, Lithuanian, and Russian
  - The now lost ancestor of these cognate languages is referred to as Indo-European
- **Inflected Language**
  - A language in which the nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs have variable endings to indicate the relationshiop of words to each other in a sentence.
  - Anglo-Saxon, like Latin, was an inflected language
  - English has lost most of its inflections
- **Derived Languages**
  - Romance languages, such as Frech, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, and Itilian share a common ancestor in Latin
  - These languages are _derived_ from Latin and thus _cognate_ with each other

  Although English ultimately derives from Anglo-Saxon, there is much more to the story.  English through Anglo-Saxon is cognate with Latin, but has borrowed so many words from the language our vocabular countains thousands of Latin cognates and derivitives.  This has occured over a span of several centuries.

  - Grimm's Law
    - Important linguistic principle of sound change in the evolution of Germanic languages
    - Describes shifts in consonants such as **p** to **f**, hard **c (k)** to **h**, and **d** to **t**

## The Alphabet and Pronunciation

- Romans learned to write from the Etruscans...
- Who learned to write from Greek colonists near Naples
  - Roman alphabet is one form of the Greek alphabet
- Who adapted the Greek alphabet from the Phoenicians
  - Whose 22 letters were influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphics
  - Phoenician letters represented only consonant sounds
  - Greeks used some of the letters to designate vowel sounds

The Roman alphabet was like our except...

- It lacked the letters **j** and **w**
- The letter **v** stood for both
  - The sound of the vowel **u**
  - The sound on the consonant **w**
    - A literal "double u" i.e., vv
  - For convenience **v** and **u** are used in modern Latin texts
- The letter **k** was rarely used
  - Only before **a** in a few words
- The letters **y** and **z** were introduced towards the end of the Republic
  - Used in spelling words of Greek origin

### Vowels

Vowels in Latin had essentially two possible pronunciations, long and short

- Long
 - Held about twice as long as short vowels
 - Marked in most beginning texts with a **macron** or **long mark**
   - Should be considered part of the spelling since differences are crucial to meaning
     - **liber** is a _noun_ meaning _book_
     - **līber** is an _adjective_ meaning _free_
    - Roman occasional, not always, marked long vowels in a variety of ways
      - More commonly with an **apex** resembling an accute accent (**líber**)
      - Sometime by writing them larger (**lIber**) or twice (**liiber**)

| Long | Short |
| --- | --- |
| ā as in _father_: **dās, cārā** | **a** as in _Dinah_: **dat, casa** |
| ē as in _they_: **mē, sēdēs** | **e** as in _pet_: **et, sed** |
| ī as in _machine_: **hīc, sīca** | **i** as in _pin_: **hic, sicca** |
| ō as in _clover_: **ōs, mōrēs** | **o** as in _orb, off_: **os, mora** |
| ū as in _rude_: **tū, sūmō** | **u** as in _put_: **tum, sum** |

**y** as in French **tu**, or German **über**: **tyrannus**

### Dipthongs

Latin has six dipthongs, combinations of two vowel sounds that were collapsed together into a single syllable.

- **ae** as _ai_ in _aisle_: **cārae, saepe**
- **au** as _ou_ in _house_: **aut, laudō**
- **ei** as in _reign_: **deinde**
- **eu** as Latin **e** + **u**, pronounced rapidly as a single syllable: **seu**
  - Sound does not occur in English and is rare in Latin
- **oe** as _oi_ in _oil_: **coepit, proelium**
- **ui** as in Latin **u** + **i**, spoken as a single syllable like Spanish **muy**
  - Occurs only in **huius, cuius, huic, cui, hui**
  - Elswhere the two letters are spoken separately

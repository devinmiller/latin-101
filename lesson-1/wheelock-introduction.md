## Latin Language in History

- **Cognate Languages**
  - Languages that share a common ancestor are referred to as cognate languages
  - English, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Anglo-Saxon, Old Irish, Lithuanian, and Russian
  - The now lost ancestor of these cognate languages is referred to as Indo-European
- **Inflected Language**
  - A language in which the nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs have variable endings to indicate the relationshiop of words to each other in a sentence.
  - Anglo-Saxon, like Latin, was an inflected language
  - English has lost most of its inflections
- **Derived Languages**
  - Romance languages, such as Frech, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, and Itilian share a common ancestor in Latin
  - These languages are _derived_ from Latin and thus _cognate_ with each other

  Although English ultimately derives from Anglo-Saxon, there is much more to the story.  English through Anglo-Saxon is cognate with Latin, but has borrowed so many words from the language our vocabular countains thousands of Latin cognates and derivitives.  This has occured over a span of several centuries.

  - Grimm's Law
    - Important linguistic principle of sound change in the evolution of Germanic languages
    - Describes shifts in consonants such as **p** to **f**, hard **c (k)** to **h**, and **d** to **t**

## A Brief Survey of Latin Literature

- Archaic through Early Republican Period (down to ca. 80 B.C.)
  - 4th and 5th century B.B.
    - The apogee of Greek civilization
    - Highest development of its literature and art
    - Rome has little to offer during this time
  - 3rd century B.C.
    - Roman expansion brings them into contact with Greek civilization
    - Roman writers begin going to school to learn Greek literature.
    - Greek literature had a tremendous and continuing influence on Roman literature from this time on despite it developing its own character and originality
- Late Republican and Augustan Period (the "Golden Age": 80 B.C. - A.D. 14)
  - During this time Roman writers perfected their literary media and made it one of the world's greatest
  - Ciceronian Period (80-40 B.C.)
    - Literary works of this period were produced were produced duringthe last years of the Roma Republic

  - Also the incorporation of diction from vulgar (common) Latin
  - Important authors:
    - Fronto
    - Aulus Gellius
- Patristic Period (late 2nd - 5th cent.)
  - Much of the vital literature was the work of Christian leaders (or _fathers_)
  - Classical was deliberately employed to impress the pagans at times
  - Increasingly, the concern was to reach the common people (vulgus) with the Chrstian message
    - Caused a re-emergence of vulgar Latin (the language of the common people) in contemporary literature

- Medieval Period (6th - 14th cent.)
  - Vulgar Latin underwent rapid changes, reaching a point where it could no longer be called Latin and became the various Romance languages
  - Latin continued as the living language of the Church and intellectual world
  - Latin was an international language, and in Medieval Latin was written a varied and living literature
- Renaissance (15 cent.) to the Present
  - Renaissance scholar scorned Medieval Latin and returned to the elegant Ciceronian idiom
  - Artificial movement, made Latin imitative and static compared to the spontaneus, living laguage of the Middle Ages
  - Continued to be effectively employed well into the modern ago
    - Eraasmus and Sir Thomas More in the 16th century
    - Milton, Bacon, and Newton in the 17th century
    - Botanists, classical scholars, and poets of later centuries
    - Ecclesiastical strain still alive in the Roman Catholic Church 

## The Alphabet and Pronunciation

- Romans learned to write from the Etruscans...
- Who learned to write from Greek colonists near Naples
  - Roman alphabet is one form of the Greek alphabet
- Who adapted the Greek alphabet from the Phoenicians
  - Whose 22 letters were influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphics
  - Phoenician letters represented only consonant sounds
  - Greeks used some of the letters to designate vowel sounds

The Roman alphabet was like our except...

- It lacked the letters **j** and **w**
- The letter **v** stood for both
  - The sound of the vowel **u**
  - The sound of the consonant **w**
    - A literal "double u" i.e., vv
  - For convenience **v** and **u** are used in modern Latin texts
- The letter **k** was rarely used
  - Only before **a** in a few words
- The letters **y** and **z** were introduced towards the end of the Republic
  - Used in spelling words of Greek origin

### Vowels

Vowels in Latin had essentially two possible pronunciations, long and short

- Long
 - Held about twice as long as short vowels
 - Marked in most beginning texts with a **macron** or **long mark**
   - Should be considered part of the spelling since differences are crucial to meaning
     - **liber** is a _noun_ meaning _book_
     - **līber** is an _adjective_ meaning _free_
    - Roman occasional, not always, marked long vowels in a variety of ways
      - More commonly with an **apex** resembling an accute accent (**líber**)
      - Sometime by writing them larger (**lIber**) or twice (**liiber**)

| Long | Short |
| --- | --- |
| <a href ="../audio/introduction/vowels/a as in Father.mp3">ā as in _father_</a>: **dās, cārā** | <a href="../audio/introduction/vowels/a as in Dinah.mp3">**a** as in _Dinah_</a>: **dat, casa** |
| ē as in _they_: **mē, sēdēs** | **e** as in _pet_: **et, sed** |
| ī as in _machine_: **hīc, sīca** | **i** as in _pin_: **hic, sicca** |
| ō as in _clover_: **ōs, mōrēs** | **o** as in _orb, off_: **os, mora** |
| ū as in _rude_: **tū, sūmō** | **u** as in _put_: **tum, sum** |

**y** as in French **tu**, or German **über**: **tyrannus**

### Diphthongs

Latin has six dipthongs, combinations of two vowel sounds that were collapsed together into a single syllable.

- **ae** as _ai_ in _aisle_: **cārae, saepe**
- **au** as _ou_ in _house_: **aut, laudō**
- **ei** as in _reign_: **deinde**
- **eu** as Latin **e** + **u**, pronounced rapidly as a single syllable: **seu**
  - Sound does not occur in English and is rare in Latin
- **oe** as _oi_ in _oil_: **coepit, proelium**
- **ui** as in Latin **u** + **i**, spoken as a single syllable like Spanish **muy**
  - Occurs only in **huius, cuius, huic, cui, hui**
  - Elswhere the two letters are spoken separately

### Consonants

https://github.com/devinmiller/latin-101/blob/main/audio/introduction/a%20as%20in%20Father.mp3

Latin consonants had essentially the same sounds as the English consonants with the following exceptions:

- **bs** and **bt** were pronounced _ps_ and _pt_
- **b** had the same voiced sound as our letter
- **c** was always hard as in _can_, never soft as in _city_
- **g** was always hard as in _get_, never soft as in _gem_
- **ng** represented a nasalized _ng_ sound as in _hangnail_
- **h** was a breathing sound, as in English, only less harshly pronounced
- _consonantal_ **i** is pronounced like _y_ in _yes_
  - appears in English derivatives as the letter _j_
- _vowel_ **i**, between two vowels, forms a dipthong with the first
  - otherwise it was usually a vowel
- **m** same sound as English, pronounced with lips closed
- **m** following a vowel at end of word pronounced with lips open
  - produced a nasalization of the preceding vowel
  - one of the few Latin sounds not occuring in English
- **q** always followed by consonantal **u**, sounds like _kw_
- **r** was trilled
- **s** was always voiceless as in _see_, never voiced as in _ease_
- **t** sounds like _t_ as in _tired_, never _sh_ like in _nation_ or _ch_ as in _mention_
- **v** had the sound of our _w_
- **x** sounds like _ks_ in _axle_, not of _gz_ as in _exert_
- **ch** had the sound of _ckh_ in _blockhead_, not of _ch_ in _church_
- **th** had the sound of _th_ in _hothouse_, not of _th_ in _thin_ or _the_

The Romans pronounced double consonants as two seperate consonants.

### Syllables

In Latin, as in English, a word has as many syllables as it has in vowels and diphthongs.

#### Syllabification 

In dividing a word into syllables:

1. Two contiguous vowels or a vowel and a diphthong are separated
1. A single consonant between two vowels goes with the second vowel
1. When two or more consonants stand between two vowels, generally only the last consonant goes with the second vowel
  - A stop (**p, b, t, d, c, g**) plus a liquid (**l, r**) generally count as a single consonant and go with the following vowel
    - There are common exceptions to this in poetry
  - **qu** and the aspirates **ch, ph, th** count as single consonants which should never be seperated

#### Syllable quantity

1. A syllable is _long by nature_ if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong
1. A syllable is _long by position_ if it contains two or more consonants or by **x**
  - **x** is a double consonant ( = _ks_)
1. Otherwise a syllable is short
1. Remember that a stop plus a liquid, **qu**, and the aspirates **ch, ph,** and **th** regularly count as a single consonant

Even in English, syllables have a temporal quantity with some taking longer to pronounce than others but it is not a phenomenon we think much about.  The matter is important in latin for two reasons:

1. Syllable quantity was a major determinant of the rhythm in Latin poetry
1. Syllable quantity determined the position of the stress accent in words of three or more syllables

### Accent

Words in Latin, like those in English, were pronounced with extra emphasis on one syllable (sometimes more).  The placement of this _stress accent_ followed these strict and simple rules:

1. In a word of two syllable the accent always falls on the first syllable
1. In a word of three or more syllables:
  - the accent falls on the next to last syllable (_penult_) if that syllable is long
  - otherwise, the accent falls on the syllable before that (_antepenult_)

Becuase these rules for accentuation are so regular, accent marks are not ordinarily included when writing Latin.

## The Importance of Pronunciation and Reading Aloud

A reasonably correct and consistent pronunciation  is essential to the mastery of Latin, as of any language.  Latin did not merely consist of written texts to be read mutely from a printed page, it was for a millennium and more a living language read and spoken by average Roman women and men.

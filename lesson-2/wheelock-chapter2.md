All about nouns.

## Nouns

- A noun identifies a person, place, or thing, either generally (_common nouns_)
or specifically (_proper nouns_).
- Nouns are also categorized as abstact (**īra**, _anger_) or concrete (**porta**, gate).

As a Latin verb has various inflections or endings that signal specifics of meaning, so a noun has various terminations to show wether it functions as a verb's subject or object, indicates possession, etc.  The inflected forms of a noun are called cases.  

Refer to the following English sentences for demonstrative prurposes:

A. The poet is giving the girl large roses (_or_ is giving large roses to the girl).
B. The girls are giving the poet's roses to the sailors.
C. Without money the girl's country (_or_ the country of the girl) is not stoing.

### Nominative Case

- Most commonly used to indicate the **subject** of a finite verb
  - "poet" in sentence A
  - "girls" in sentence B
- Also as a **predicate nominative** with forms of _to be_ and other linking verbs
  - **Puella est poēta**, _the girl is a poet_
  - **Patria est antīqua**, _the country is ancient_

### Genitive Case

- When one noun is used to modify another
  - _poet's_ in sentence B
  - _girl's_ in sentence C
- One idea commonly conveyed by the genetive is **possession**
  - generally be translated with the preposition "of"
  - or by using an apostrophy (_'s_ or _s'_)
- A noun in the genitive case usually follows the noun it modifies

### Dative Case

- Most common use is to mark **indirect objects**
  - the person or thing affected by the verb's action
  - _(to) the girl_ in sentence A
  - _to the sailors_ in sentence B
- "To" or "for" are most commonly supplied in translating a dative

### Accusative Case

- Used to indicate the **direct object** of the verb
  - the person or thing directly affected by the verb's action
  - In sentences A and B, _roses_ is the direct object of _is (are) giving_
- Can also be used as **object of a preposition** with certin prepositions
  - **ad**, _toward/at_; **in*, _into_; **post**, _after, behind_
  - preposition is usually placed before it's "object"
    - together forming a preposition phrase to modify a noun or verb
- Most prepositions govern objects in either the ablative or accusative

All about nouns.

## Nouns

- A noun identifies a person, place, or thing, either generally (_common nouns_)
or specifically (_proper nouns_).
- Nouns are also categorized as abstact (**īra**, _anger_) or concrete (**porta**, gate).

As a Latin verb has various inflections or endings that signal specifics of meaning, so a noun has various terminations to show wether it functions as a verb's subject or object, indicates possession, etc.  The inflected forms of a noun are called cases.  

Refer to the following English sentences for demonstrative prurposes:

A. The poet is giving the girl large roses (_or_ is giving large roses to the girl).

B. The girls are giving the poet's roses to the sailors.

C. Without money the girl's country (_or_ the country of the girl) is not stoing.

### Nominative Case

- Most commonly used to indicate the **subject** of a finite verb
  - "poet" in sentence A
  - "girls" in sentence B
- Also as a **predicate nominative** with forms of _to be_ and other linking verbs
  - **Puella est poēta**, _the girl is a poet_
  - **Patria est antīqua**, _the country is ancient_

### Genitive Case

- When one noun is used to modify another
  - _poet's_ in sentence B
  - _girl's_ in sentence C
- One idea commonly conveyed by the genetive is **possession**
  - generally be translated with the preposition "of"
  - or by using an apostrophy (_'s_ or _s'_)
- A noun in the genitive case usually follows the noun it modifies

### Dative Case

- Most common use is to mark **indirect objects**
  - the person or thing affected by the verb's action
  - _(to) the girl_ in sentence A
  - _to the sailors_ in sentence B
- "To" or "for" are most commonly supplied in translating a dative

### Accusative Case

- Used to indicate the **direct object** of the verb
  - the person or thing directly affected by the verb's action
  - In sentences A and B, _roses_ is the direct object of _is (are) giving_
- Can also be used as **object of a preposition** with certin prepositions
  - **ad**, _toward/at_; **in*, _into_; **post**, _after, behind_
  - preposition is usually placed before it's "object"
    - together forming a preposition phrase to modify a noun or verb
- Most prepositions govern objects in either the ablative or accusative

### Ablative Case

- Used to modify, or limit, the verb by such ideas as:
  - _means_ ("by/with what": **pecūniā**, _with money_)
  - _agent_ ("by whom": **ab puellā**, _by the girl_)
  - _accompaniment_ ("with whom": **cum poētā**, with the poet)
  - _manner_ ("how": **cum īrā**, _with anger, angrily_)
  - _place_ ("where/from which": **in/ex patriā**, _in/from the country_)
  - time ("when/within which": **ūnā hōrā**, in one hour)
- Ablatibe was often used as object of preposition
  - When preposition not used, supply "by", "with", or "from" when translating

### Vocative Case

- Used to address or call on a person or thing directly
  - **Salvē nauta**, _Greetings, sailor_
- Sometimes included the **interjection ō** when employeed
  - **Ō puella, servā mē**, _O (oh) girl, save me!_
- I modern punctuation, the vocative is seperated from the rest of the sentence by commas
- With one major exception, the vocative has the same form as the nominative

## First Declension Nouns and Adjectives

The listing of all the cases of a noun or adjective is called a **declension**.  Just a we conjugate verbs, we **decline** nouns and adjectives by adding endings to a base.

### Declension Example

Noun/Adjective phrase: **porta magna**, _the large gate_

- Latin lacked equivalents of English "a," "an," and "the," they must be added in translation.

| Singular | **porta**, _gate_, | **magna**, _large_ | | Endings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
| _Base_ | port- | magn- | |
| _Nom_ | porta | magna | _the (a) large gate | **-a** |
| _Gen._ | portae | magnae | _of the large gate_ | **-ae** |
| _Dat._ | portae | magnae | _to/for the large gate_ | **-ae** |
| _Acc._ | portam | magnam | _the large gate_  | **-am** |
| _Abl._ | portā | magnā | _by/with/from, etc., the large gate_ | **-ā** |
| _Voc._ | porta | magna | _O large gate_ | **-a** |

| Plural | **porta**, _gate_, | **magna**, _large_ | | Endings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
| _Base_ | port- | magn- | |
| _Nom_ | portae | magnae | _the large gates or large gates | **-ae** |
| _Gen._ | portārum | magnārum | _of the large gates_ | **-ārum** |
| _Dat._ | portīs | magnīs | _to/for the large gates_ | **-īs** |
| _Acc._ | portās | magnās | _the large gates_  | **-ās** |
| _Abl._ | portīs | magnīs | _by/with/from, etc., the large gates_ | **īs** |
| _Voc._ | portae | magnae | _O large gate_ | **-ae** |

## Gender

Like English, Latin distinguishes three **genders**:

1. Masculine
1. Feminine
1. Neuter

A noun's gender must be memorized as part of the vocabulary.

## Adjectives, Agreement, and Word Order

An **adjective** "adds" information about, or "modifies", a noun or pronoun.  Adjectives used as simple modifiers to describe "attributes" of nouns in this way are called **attribute adjectives**.  

Like nouns, adjectives are declined, and _an adjective afress with its noun in gender, number, and case_.

- An adjective was usually positioned next to its noun
  - Except in poetry, where order is freer
- Most often the adjective followed the noun, exceptions were:
  - Adjectives denoting size of number
  - Deomonstratives (**hic**, _this_; **ille**, _that_) which normally precede
  - Adjectives which the speaker or writer wishes to emphasize

## Grammer: Morphology and Syntax

Two major aspects of a language's **grammer** are its morphology and syntax.

Morphology
: Refers to the forms of words, such as verb conjugations and noun-adjective declensions

Syntax
: Refers to the arrangement and interrelation of words to form meaningful phrases, clauses, and sentences.

The sentences presented earlier, here translated into Latin, provide some examples.

A. **Poēta puella magnās rosās dat.**

B. **Puella nautīs rosās poētae dant**

C. **Patria puellārum sine pecūniā nõn valet**

| Word | Form | Dependence | Use/Function
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Sentence A_ | | | |
| poēta | nom. sg. | dat | subject |
| puellae | dat. sg. | dat | indirect object |
| magnās | acc. pl. | rosās | modifies and agrees with noun |
| _Sentence B_ | | | |
| puellae | nom. pl. | dant | subject |
| nautīs | dat. pl. | dant | indirect object |
| rosās | acc. pl. | dant | direct object |
| poēta | gen. sg. | rosās | possession |
| _Sentence C_ | | | |
| pecūniā | abl. sg. | sine | object of preposition |

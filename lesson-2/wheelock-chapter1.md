# Chapter 1

A verb describes it subject's activity or state of being, and is this one of the most important words in a sentence.

## Verbs

In Latin, as in English, verbs exhibit the following five characteristics:

1. Person
  - Who is the subject, i.e., who performs (or, in the passive, receives) the action from the speakers point of view
  - 1st person = the speaker(s) _I, we_
  - 2nd person = the person(s) spoken to, _you_
  - 3rd person = the person(s) spoken about, _he, she, it, they_
1. Number
  - How many subjects, singular or plural
1. Tense
  - the time of the action; Latin has six tenses
    - present
    - future
    - imperfect
    - perfect
    - future imperfect
    - pluperfect
1. Mood
  - the manner of indicating the action or state of being of the verb
    - **indicitave** (which "indicates" facts)
    - **imperative** (which orders actions)
    - **subjunctive** (which describes hypothetical or potential actions)
1. Voice
  - An indication, with transitive verbs (those that can take direct objects) of whether the subject performs the action (**actibe voice**) or receives it (**passive voice**)

### Conjugation

To conjugate a **finite verb** (as opposed to _in_finitives, which lack person and number) is to list all its forms, according to these variations of person, number, tense, mood, and voice.

Latin uses **personal** endings to indicate distinctly the person, the number, and the voice of the verb.

For the _active_ voice they are:

| **Singular** | |
| --- | --- |
| _1st person_ | **-ō** or **-m**, which corresponds to _I_ |
| _2nd person_ | **-s**, which corresponds to _you_ (singular) |
| _3rd person_ | **-t**, which corresponds to _he, she, it_ |

| **Plural** | |
| --- | --- |
| _1st person_ | **-mus**, which corresponds to _we_ |
| _2nd person_ | **-tis**, which corresponds to _you_ (plural) |
| _3rd person_ | **-nt**, which corresponds to _they_ |

### Present Active Infinitive and Present Stem

An **infinitive** in a common verbal form, usually preceded with "to" in English (to praise, to advise).

| First Conugation | Second Conjugation |
| - | - |
| **laudāre**, _to praise_ | **monēre**, _to advise_ |

The **āre** ending, with its **-ā-** _stem vowel_, identifies a verb as first conjugation; **-ēre** and the **-ē-** characterize second conjugation verbs.  Drop the **-re**, the actual infinitive ending, and you have the _present stem_.  To this stem add the personal endings.

### Shortening Long Vowels

Vowels that are normally long are regularly shortened when:

1. Occuring immediately before another long vowel
1. Before **-m, -r,** or **-t** at word end
1. Before **nt** or **nd** in any position

## Present Active Imperative

The _imperative_ **mood** is used for giving commands; the singular imperative is identical to the present stem, and the plural imperative is formed by adding **-te** to the stem.

| 2nd person singular | 2nd person plural |
| - | - |
| laúdā, _praise!_ | laudāte, _praise!_ |
| mónē, _advise!_ | monēte, _advise!_ |

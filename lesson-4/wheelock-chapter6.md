Sum and Possum

## Future and Imperfect Indicative of _Sum_

Mostly just memorize, though these forms are more consistent than those for the present.  Each is formed on the stem **-er** and with the familiar present system personal endings (**-ō/-m, -s, -t, -mus, -tis, -nt**)

| | Future Indicative | Imperfect Indicative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | erō, _I shall be_ | eram, _I was_ |
| **Sg.** | eris, _you will be_ | erās, _you were_ |
| | erit, _he (she, it, there) will be_ | erat, _he (she, it, there) was_ |
| | erimus, _we shall be_ | erāmus, _we were_ |
| **Pl.** | eritis, _you will be_ | erātis, _you were |
| | erunt, _they (there) will be_ | erant, _they (there) were_ |

## Irregular _Possum, Posse, Potui_, To Be Able, Can, Could

| | Present Indicative | Future Indicative | Imperfect Indicative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | _I am able, can_ | _I shall be able_ | _I was able, could_ |
| | possum | poterō | poteram |
| **Sg.** | potes | poteris | poterās |
| | potest | poterit | poterat |
| | possumus | poterimus | poterāmus |
| **Pl.** | potestis | poteritis | poterātis |
| | possunt | poterunt | poterant |

## Complimentary Infinitive

**Possum** requires an infinitive to "complete" its meaning, hence the term **complimentary infinitive**.  This has already been seen in use with the verb **debēre**.

A complimentary infinitive has no seperate subject of its own; its subject is the same as that of the verb on which it depends.

# For the Roman virtues assignment.

Define virtus, pietas, and dignitas.

## Virtus

"Courage" - Especially of leaders within society and government.

It carries connotations of valor, manliness, excellence, courage, character, and worth, perceived as masculine strengths (from Latin vir, "man").

## Pietas

"Piety, Dutifulness" - People paying honor to the gods

More than religious piety, it is closer to the idea of "Dutifulness", a respect for the natural order socially, politically, and religiously. This includes the ideas of patriotism and devotion to others.

Pietas translates as “piety,” which referred to doing the right thing.

## Dignitas

"Dignity" - A sense of self-worth, personal pride.

Dignitas was the influence a male citizen acquired throughout his life, including personal reputation, moral standing, and ethical worth, along with the man's entitlement to respect and proper treatment owing to the reputation and standing of his family.

More tenses.  And some adjectives.

## Future and Imperfect Tenses

The Romans indicated future time in the first two conjugations by

- Inserting the future _tense sign_ (**-bi-** in most forms) between the present stem and the person endings
- Inserting the imperfect _tense sign_ (**-bā** in all four conjugation), between the present stem and the personal endings

The _infixes_ **-bi-** and **-bā-** can be remembered as signs of the future and imperfect tenses by associating them with the English auxiliary verbs "will" and "was", spelled with _-i-_ and _-a-_, and generally used to translate those two tenses.

## Adjectives of the First and Second Declension in -er

There are several first/second declension adjectives whose masculine nominative singular ends with **-er** rather than **-us**; some, like the noun retain the **-e** in the base, and other, like the noun **ager**, drop the **-e**.
